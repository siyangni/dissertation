Note: All age 17 self-control variables are now processed.
All recoded variables have prefix 'sc17_' to distinguish from other age variables.
All values other than 1, 2, or 3 are coded as missing (NA).
STANDARDIZED CODING: All variables use 0-2 scale where HIGHER values = HIGHER self-control.
Originally reverse-coded variables: 1->0, 2->1, 3->2
Originally normal-coded variables: 1->2, 2->1, 3->0 (reverse-coded for consistency)

=== MASTER SCRIPT COMPLETION SUMMARY ===
Successfully processed self-control variables for ages: 3, 5, 7, 11, 14, 17 

Total new self-control variables created: 126 
Age 3 variables: 21 
Age 5 variables: 21 
Age 7 variables: 21 
Age 11 variables: 21 
Age 14 variables: 21 
Age 17 variables: 21 

=== NEXT STEPS ===
1. The merged_data object now contains all recoded self-control variables
2. Consider saving the updated dataset: saveRDS(merged_data, 'path/to/updated_data.rds')
3. Proceed with longitudinal growth curve modeling or other analyses

In addition: Warning messages:
1: In measEq.syntax(configural.model = configural_model, data = merged_data,  :
  For factors measured only by categorical indicators, constraints on intercepts are insufficient to identify latent means when the intercepts are already fixed to zero in order to identify latent item scales.  To preventunderidentified models, it is recommended to instead set ID.fac = "std.lv".
2: In psych::alpha(recoded_parenting_age7[, overall], check.keys = TRUE) :
  Some items were negatively correlated with the first principal component and were automatically reversed.
 This is indicated by a negative sign for the variable name.
